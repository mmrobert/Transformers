# SwiftUI and Combine

1. I run app using simulator “iPhone 12 Pro max”.
2. Please run app at least iOS version 13.1 as  SwiftUI and Combine are used.
3. MVVM architecture is used.
4. Using Combine framework for data processing and binding, including network fetch.
5. Unit test is added for network service including mock response.
6. Using CoreData for cache, only for JSON response, in file “CoreDataCache.swift”
7. Thumb image loading is done by third party framework "SDWebImageSwiftUI”.
8. Thumb image cache is provided by "SDWebImageSwiftUI”, setup at file “AppDelegate.swift”.
9. May need run “pod install” to install third party framework.
